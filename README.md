# commonmarkdown-clj

A Clojure implementation of the Common Markdown 0.24 spec.  I am hand-coding
everything as a refresher for both myself (it's been a while since I've 
implemented one, the last time probably at university) and for other 
people as a learning tool.  My hope is that someone thinking about 
implementing, or learning how to implement, their own micro-language can 
use this to get over the initial hurdles of a naive approach. My intent 
is to prefer readability and understandability over high-performance to 
maximize the readers ability to understand and modify the code. That being
said, I will make any reasonable performance optimizations I can that do
not contravene those goals.

I based the structure on the [Gabo](https://github.com/fhur/gabo) templating 
language library for Clojure, another educational project.  Many thanks 
to Github user  [fhur](https://github.com/fhur) for the inspiration.
